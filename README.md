Teaching Website Senior Project

This project was developed on Node.js using various libraries, including Passport.js and Express.js.

All front end was developed using Handlebars for HTML insertion, Bootstrap 4 for appearance, and jQuery for responsive webpages.

To run this system, ensure you have the latest version of MySQL and Node.js installed.

Run the database setup statements located in the 'databases' folder to set up the database.

Adjust 'database.js' in the 'lib' folder to match your MySQL instance.

Use either Node or nodemon to run the system from the root folder of the project.

The system includes 2 teachers, 'teacher@teacher.com' and 'teacher2@teacher.com', both with password 'teacher', as well as 2 students, 'student@student.com' and 'student2@student.com', both with password 'student'.
